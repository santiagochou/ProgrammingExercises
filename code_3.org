* 1. Two Sum
Reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

** my solution 1:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<int> output;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<nums.size();j++){
                if(nums[j] == target - nums[i]){
                    output.push_back(i);
                    output.push_back(j);
                }
            }
        }
        return output;
    }
};
#+END_SRC

** Summary:
   It's very simple but also can be optimized quicker.
